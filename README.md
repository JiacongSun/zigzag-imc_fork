# ZigZag-IMC
This repository presents the extended version of ZigZag, a HW Architecture-Mapping Design Space Exploration (DSE) Framework.
This extension is specifically designed to support In-Memory Computing (IMC).
ZigZag-IMC bridges the gap between algorithmic DL decisions and their IMC acceleration cost on specialized accelerators through a fast and accurate HW cost estimation. 

## Prerequisite

To get started, you can install all packages directly through pip using the pip-requirements.txt with the command:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Getting Started
The main script is main_onnx.py, which takes into 3 input files:
- .onnx: workload definition.
- mapping: user-provided spatial mapping or spatial mapping restriction.
- accelerator: hardware definition.

The repository includes three examples provided in the `run.sh` script, which are:
- an example for a pure digital PE-based hardware template.
- an example for an SRAM-based Digital In-Memory Computing hardware template.
- an example for an SRAM-based Analog In-Memory Computing hardware template.

The output will be saved under `outputs/` folder.

## New features
In this novel version, in addition to the features found in the basic zigzag, we have introduced several new capabilities:
- **New cost models**: Added support for SRAM-based Analog In-Memory Computing and Digital In-Memory Computing (28nm).
- **Dataflow optimization***: Inner layer data will remain in lower memory if it is expected to be used by the next layer along the same branch.
- **Mix Spatial Mapping***: Mix user-defined spatial mapping is now allowed (e.g. `inputs/examples/mapping/default_imc.py`).
- **Diagonal OX/OY Mapping***: Computing array now supports diagonal OX/OY mapping.
- **Automatic Mix Spatial Mapping***: Spatial mapping will be autogenerated if a `spatial_mapping_hint` is provided in the mapping file.
- **Simulation Speedup**: Only the three spatial mappings with the highest hardware utilization will be assessed to ensure fast simulation speed.

*: features are planned to be integrated into the base ZigZag framework.

## In-Memory Computing Model Description
Our SRAM-based In-Memory Computing model is a versatile, parameterized model designed to cater to both Analog IMC and Digital IMC.
Since hardware costs are technology-node dependent, we have performed special calibration for the 28nm technology node. The model has been validated against 7 chips from the literature. 
A summary of the hardware settings for these chips is provided in the following table.

B<sub>i</sub>/B<sub>o</sub>/B<sub>cycle</sub>: input precision/weight precision/number of bits processed per cycle per input.
#cell_group: the number of cells sharing one entry to computation logic.

The validation results are displayed in the figure below (assuming 50% input toggle rate and 50% weight sparsity are assumed). 
The gray bar represents the reported performance value, while the colored bar represents the model estimation.

- AIMC1 incurs additional area costs due to repeaters/decaps.
- Sparsity information is not available for AIMC2, DIMC2, DIMC4.
- AIMC1, AIMC3 were fabricated using 22nm technology, therefore the cost estimation was scaled accordingly.


**Note:**

The current IMC model has certain limitations and is applicable only under the following conditions:
- The SRAM cell is a 6T memory cell.
- The adder tree follows a RCA (Ripple Carry Adder) structure without any approximation logic.
- The operands are of integer type rather than floating point.
- The voltage is fixed at 0.9 V.
- Sparsity impact has not been considered in the energy estimation.
